# Entity-Component-System

This implementation was done as a test task for a gaming company. The main disadvantage of Entity–component–system - it destroys one of the pillars of OOD – encapsulation. Another disadvantage - ECS is a table-like approach. Which is less convenient for human to understand/debug, when comparing with good designed hierarchy. As an old school, I prefer classic hierarchy design. 
Anyway, the task was done, and I provide it here. Implementation I show here is one of the ways. I came to conclusion that some combination of both approaches might be beneficial in certain scenarios.
